just studying hoping to be better

Assigment 1:
Just learnt post,get,update,delete in express and in a seperate file and the main file uses it and -->> app.use('/books',booksrouter) and difference between req,and res. hopefully more to come 











Assigment 2 :
Just learnt to implement a simple middleware:
module.exports(req,res,next)=>{
const authheader=req.headers.authorization
if it equals something do something
}
testing it with postman ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/293f725d-683b-4ef3-9eb3-53d201bc3e0a) 
without the correct authorization ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8385a46-6324-4aec-9881-e4883bf0797e)  it doesnt work
